It is rare that I get my picture taken while playing pinball, so I was very exicted to see this one was taken while I was playing in the weekly tournaments at Level1 barcade in Gilbert, Arizona.  We have fun driving there every Thursday night to meet with friends, have a few drinks, and play some pinball. Godzilla a great pin to play and I continue to get better at it with each play.
