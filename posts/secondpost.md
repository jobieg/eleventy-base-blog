The next place while travelling in 2021 that I saw a pinball machine, but sadly was not able to play it was at Central Festival Mall in Pattaya, Thailand.

<p>I found an Avengers pinball machine, along with a few other arcade games, on the 5th floor of this mall near the movie theater. Due to COVID restrictions all the games were shut off and had a rope barrier around them. I do intend on going back to play this pin. I have played it since in Arizona and do enjoy the game play. It is always fun to locate machines in odd places.
