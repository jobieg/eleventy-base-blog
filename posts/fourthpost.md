During the weekend of February 4-6 2022 in Mesa, Arizona Starfighters Arcade hosted the first Starfighters Pinball Festival. They had over 200 pinball machines to play and 3 days of competition. On Friday, I qualified to be in the A division. There was A, B, and C division to separate the 108 players into grouops of 36.  I had confidence that I could make it into the top division, but I knew I would end up against the best. They even had world champion Bowen Kirins in attendance! No way I was beating him!

At the end of day 2, I was 2nd to last in the A division. Only the top 16 in each division would continue on to the Finals on Sunday. It was a great time of playing new games and competing on another level with locals and people from various States.
