Last year while travelling around Dubrovnik, Croatia I finally found two pinball machines near the coast at Uvala Lapad Beach about 3.7km away from the Walls of Dubrovnik.

I found a Shrek and Rolling Stones pinball machine at a little tourist stand that also had many coin operated rides for kids. When I first walked past this place these pinball machines were coverd with a simple tarp. I noticed them after we took a lovely stroll along the coast.

These machines were not in great shape. Many of the scoops or pop-ups were not functioning. My friend and pinball collector did tell me that Shrek is fairly rare with about 600 being produced. The value can range from $4600-$5400. I do wonder if shipping this from Croatia would be worth having a fun pin like this. The call outs while playing were very fun for any Shrek fan. I also played Rolling Stones, but it is not as fun and had more issues going on.
 5 kuna is about 75 cents.
